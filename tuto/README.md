# Flask mini site
[![Python](https://shields.io/badge/python-v3-blue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) 

A mini library website, built for a project during my studies.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Python (3.x.x) with [virtualvenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) installed.

### Set up the project

Create your virtualenv (virtual environment) with the following command, `python -m venv venv`

Execute : `python -m venv venv` in a shell (if you had Python in PATH).

For Windows and VSC users only : `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install requirements : `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run your flask server : `flask run`

## FAQ

### The button "Modifier" doesnt' work
That's normal. Since I can't patch this issue, please put the commands directly in `URL`, such as `author` and `book` commands.
